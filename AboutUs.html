        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          In 2019, Sapan noticed classmates struggling with assignments. Between
          juggling classes, jobs, and life, completing tasks on time felt like a
          constant battle. Fueled by coffee and a desire to help, they launched
          a small online platform offering assignment guidance. It started
          simple - clear explanations and personalized support. Word spread.
          Soon, more students found their way to Sapan's platform, now called
          Uniment. They built a team of passionate tutors, each a master in
          their field. Uniment wasn't just about completing assignments; it was
          about understanding. Today, Uniment thrives. It's a testament to the
          power of friendship, a cup of coffee, and a simple idea that blossomed
          into a supportive community for students everywhere.
